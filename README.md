Safety Belt
-----------

Good passwords are hard to remember. Belts keep your pants up.


The belt is a usb cable. Plug it into your computer, press the button,
and it will write your password as if you typed it at the keyboard.

You should be able to store a stronger password than one you can
remember. The belt does not need batteries, does not send your
password over the air, and does not need software installed on the
computer where you want to type your password.

It's built using a Teensy 2.0 with a 3-d printed case (and belt
buckle) and uses a usb cable as the belt itself.

This was done at the TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2015 hackathon with the
help of Chris Gammell and Kenji Larsen. Thanks guys!
